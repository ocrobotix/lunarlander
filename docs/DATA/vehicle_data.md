# About this vehicle data

This is an experimental open-innovation site to collaborate on modeling the Apollo and Artemis Moon Landings. Documentation is selective and by exception. It is assumed that reviewers have some background on both missions.

All content on this site has been derived from the public domain. The site will be open to comments by invited organizations until end of 2024.
